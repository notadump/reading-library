    summary: `The article argues that no single person or authority can hold all the knowledge needed to run an economy — it's scattered across millions of people. The only tool that successfully collects all that scattered knowledge into something useful is the price system (i.e., free markets).

But prices are only trustworthy when the people setting them have skin in the game — meaning they actually lose money, status, or opportunity when they're wrong. This is why prediction markets (like Polymarket) consistently outperform polls and expert panels: participants are betting real money, not just giving opinions.

The article also explains why markets fail temporarily — when people stop thinking independently and start copying each other (herd mentality), bubbles form. But reality always wins in the end. Bubbles pop, reckless bettors get wiped out, and the market "cleans itself."`,

    tldr: "An AI startup founder warns that AI has crossed a critical threshold — it can now do his entire job better than he can, it's helping build the next version of itself, and this same disruption is about to hit every white-collar profession within 1-5 years.",
    summary: `Matt Shumer, who has spent six years building an AI startup, writes a wake-up call to people outside of tech. He compares the current moment to February 2020 — when COVID was spreading but most people hadn't realized yet how much their lives were about to change.

He shares his firsthand experience: as of February 2026, new AI models (GPT-5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6) have made him essentially unnecessary for the technical work of his job. He describes telling AI what to build in plain English, walking away for hours, and coming back to finished, polished work — with the AI testing its own output before showing him.

The key insight is that AI labs deliberately made AI great at coding first because code is what builds AI. Now that AI can help build the next version of itself, each generation is smarter and arrives faster — what researchers call an "intelligence explosion." And now that coding is largely solved, these companies are moving on to every other profession.

He urges people to start using AI seriously right now, get financially prepared for disruption, and understand that the window to get ahead by being an early adopter is closing fast.`,

    tldr: "Most traders would have been better off doing literally nothing for 3 months than grinding hourly charts during a downtrend. Patience isn't laziness — it's a skill, and the speed at which you try to make it is the speed at which you lose it.",
    summary: `Heart opens with a powerful quote from @Husslin_: "The speed at which you try to make it, is the speed at which you lose it." The article is dedicated to traders with small portfolios trying to get rich fast.

New traders want explosive results — they gravitate toward leverage and low time frames (1H charts and below) because spot trading feels too slow for their small accounts. Meanwhile, OGs like DonAlt post monthly and weekly charts, and new traders dismiss them thinking "what good is a monthly chart if I'm in and out in 2 hours?"

But here's the reality check: DonAlt posted bearish ETH charts on November 1st when ETH was at $3,900 and BTC at $110K. Three months later, ETH was down 50% and BTC dropped to $76K. The question is brutal but fair: can you now buy 2x more ETH or BTC than you could on Nov 1st with the funds you kept trading with? If not, you were outperformed by someone who literally sat on their hands and did nothing.

The core message: sitting on your hands waiting for a trade to materialize, waiting for better conditions, or simply stepping back during a slow bleed — that's not laziness, it's a skill worth developing. Impatience pulls you into low-timeframe noise and makes you miss the big picture.`,

    tldr: "Social media evolved from who you know (social graph) to what you like (interest graph). With AI commoditizing content and engagement, the next era will be the speculation graph — where your portfolio is your profile, your trade is your post, and your PNL is your reputation.",
    summary: `The article traces social media through three eras. The Social Graph Era (1990s-2010s) was about connecting with people you already knew — Facebook, MySpace, Instagram. Status came from WHO you knew. Connection came before content.

The Interest Graph Era (late 2010s-now) flipped that — algorithms started showing you content based on what you liked, not who you followed. TikTok, Reels, and YouTube Shorts were born. Status became how many people knew YOU. Content now preceded connection.

But now AI is commoditizing both content creation and engagement. AI can analyze algorithms for max virality and produce orders of magnitude more content. When content and engagement are both commoditized, attention is no longer the scarcest resource.

The author argues the next scarce resource is RISK — the willingness to put real money behind your opinions. This leads to the Speculation Graph Era, powered by onchain infrastructure. For the first time, all speculation can be verified on a public, transparent ledger. No survivorship bias. No fake screenshots.

The portfolio becomes the profile. The trade becomes the post. The PNL becomes the reputation. The next generation of creators will be powered by outperformance in speculation.`,

For lefty, it makes him sell EARLIER — because if it's been dry and he's finally up, he locks it in.\n\n5. TRUST YOUR SKILL: Every dry period feels like 'it's over forever.'

But your brain tricks you — you only remember the ones that kept mooning, not the ones that went to zero after you sold. The dodged bullets are invisible.\n\n2. STAY IN YOUR LANE: Comparing your PNL to others is a psyop. Different people start from different positions. Jealousy leads to oversizing and ruin.\n\n3. COMPOUND, DON'T YOLO: Sound risk management and steady compounding beats trying to hit one kingmaker trade. Betting the whole bankroll on one shot is how good traders blow up.\n\n4. FORGET YOUR OLD TARGETS: Past ATH, past net worth goals — erase them. No targets, no arbitrary finish lines. Just make the best decision for your current situation with the cards you have right now.\n\n5. PUT THE WORK IN: The boats are burned. Only way is forward. Don't get outworked.",

    originalText: "[Blue messages - lefty speaking to OJ]\n\nThe biggest thing that changed the game for me was when i hit a big win i would start increasing my sizing by a lot and then not know how to manage it properly and chew myself up. So id take a couple days off and not really open anything new and just sit in cash mostly after offramping a bit of that and dont change your position. Youve hit six figure trades twice now doing what youre doing and most people cant say that.\n\nSo just keep doin what youre doing and dont alter your system now that youve got some more money to work with because i think from what ive seen thats what causes people to chase and or zero out the most.\n\nWhen theres this reverse tendency of \"damn i made x amount with 15k imagine what i can make with $50k\" and that tends to get people into trouble particularly because we're late cycle even though there probably is some kind of leg up that comes soon.\n\nAnd also take urself to a nice dinner to remind yourself that the money is very real bc some ppl dont do that part either and its easy to forget like \"whoa i can actually do a lot with this fake internet money\"\n\n[OJ's additional notes]\n\nBeing aggressive about stabling was a game changer for me. Some people say that's pussy shit. We expose ourselves to high risk every single day. If the goal is stacking bread and compounding it via trading, i move better when i have reduced overall risk.\n\nWhen market is hot i keep half stables half majors (say sol, bnb, whatever else wherever im trading) and shove profits over to a side wallet + cold storage + irl.\n\nBy paying yourself regularly the money becomes real. Very easy to forget this is real money. This is both good and bad. You cant be thinking about dollar value that much or you wouldnt be risking anything at all.\n\nBut also just think about your trades in % risk of your overall port. It is very easy to take 5-10% of your port with a -50% stop loss (should be tighter than that in almost all cases) and 2-3-5-10x that regularly. Before long youve doubled your port without much overall risk and lower stress.\n\nFull porting makes u emotional. I dont think anyone should ever do it because nothing is a sure thing.\n\nManage risk = extreme growth imo.\n\nReason why people stagnate and struggle is bc they have poor coin selection and poor risk management i think.\n\nSo improve your coin selection over time, write things down, journal, do post mortems on every single trade, dont just blindly click. Have a solid reason, an expected risk if not an expected return and be aggressive with selling on the way up a couple % at a time.\n\nWe will never buy pico bottom and sell pico top so just squeeze as much as you can out of every trade and then keep ur profits in multiple different places.\n\nNever ever ever refill your hot wallet. Keep x amount in it, after you reach target number send all profits over that target number to storage wallets and run it back.\n\nThere are rare cases where it makes sense to risk like 20% of port but i dont think anybody should do this til theyre six figs.\n\nSomething like HYPE, ASTER etc is where its like ok im gonna double my usual risk bc this is high conviction (depending on where your entry is) and it doesnt completely zero you out if it fails.",

The urge to size up after winning is what destroys people.\n\n2. DON'T CHANGE YOUR SYSTEM: The 'imagine what I could make with $50k' thinking is a trap. Keep doing what got you here.\n\n3. MAKE THE MONEY REAL: Take yourself to a nice dinner. Remind yourself crypto gains are actual money you can spend.\n\n4. AGGRESSIVE STABLING: Keep half stables, half majors when market is hot. Shove profits to side wallet + cold storage + IRL spending.\n\n5. THINK IN % OF PORT: Risk 5-10% per trade with tight stops. 2-3-5-10x those regularly and you double your port with low overall risk and low stress.\n\n6. NEVER FULL PORT: It makes you emotional and nothing is a sure thing.\n\n7. MANAGE RISK = EXTREME GROWTH: Poor coin selection + poor risk management = why people stagnate.\n\n8. JOURNAL EVERYTHING: Post mortems on every trade. Have a reason for every click.\n\n9. NEVER REFILL HOT WALLET: Set a target amount, send everything above it to storage, run it back.\n\n10. RARE 20% RISKS: Only on high-conviction plays like HYPE/ASTER, and only if you're already at six figs.",
